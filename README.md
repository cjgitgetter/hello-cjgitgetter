I am a 57-year-old disabled woman.  Before becoming disabled, I spent time as a student of computer science and statistics at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts.  I worked as a software developer at ISO New England in Holyoke, Massachusetts.  I want to get off of disability and return to software development and/or tech writing.  I am a damn good developer.
